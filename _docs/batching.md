title: Send to many or Batching
tags: [usage]
---

This feature allows you to send multiple transactions in one batch. This is useful if you have two or more transactions that you want to make and spend less fees. All the transaction will be batched in a single transaction fee, making it less expensive for the sender and also they will spend less space on the blockchain. So a win-win for the bitcoin network and for the users.
