Creating a Bitcoin wallet on BlueWallet is easy.

You can either click on the "Add now" button or the "+" icon in the top right corner

That will take you to the "add wallet" screen.

## Adding a new wallet

In the "add wallet" screen, you can choose between a Bitcoin wallet and a Lightning wallet.

For Bitcoin, click on the Bitcoin button. (If you want to create a Lightning wallet, see [this guide](/docs/create-lightning-wallet).)

You may also name your wallet, or leave the default name.
