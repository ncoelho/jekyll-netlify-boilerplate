BlueWallet for Desktop is out on the mac store 

This is the first [Bitcoin-only wallet](https://bluewallet.io) available on the mac store for millions of users. And, a huge effort from the team to bring to the Bitcoin community our first desktop product.

#### [Check it out here](https://bluewallet.io/desktop-bitcoin-wallet/)

It is kind of a big deal. With a desktop product, we can start to think about things mobile doesn’t really allow us to do, like shipping a wallet with a full bitcoin node, and all the privacy gains that comes with it. Which I bet some of you will appreciate.

For now it is only available for macOS, but we expect to increase the compatibility with other platforms as we go.

#### **Let’s see what we can do from start with it, shall we.**

**HWW integration** Easily connect to your hardware wallet through watch-only and PSBTs support.

**Plausible Deniability** Create multiple storages or fake ones in case of a forced disclosure.

**Multiple Wallets** Support for different wallet types. Like Bip84/49/44, electrum, legacy, etc.

**Full node** Full node connection through ElectrumX, Electrs or Electrum Personal Server.

**Transactions control** Easily Batch, Bump or Cancel transactions. With RBF and CPFP.

**Notifications** With push notifications for pending and confirmed transactions.
