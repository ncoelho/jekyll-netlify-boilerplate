 It will be hard to believe that your phone won’t be the interface for keeping your money and interact with it. So let’s take a look on who is doing it right.

Let’s try to have a look on the wallets that are hurt giving a shot and discard all the noise out there. 

**What are the features we expect on a bitcoin wallet that will make it to the list?** 

*   Open Source
*   Users in control of their private keys
*   Replace-By-Fee (RBF/bip125)
*   Segwit support

Blue wallet

In its early stages but one of the most promising bitcoin wallets out there. 

Blue wallet focus its development on security features for the end user, like “Plausible deniability” — which consists in a fake password which decrypts fake wallets.
