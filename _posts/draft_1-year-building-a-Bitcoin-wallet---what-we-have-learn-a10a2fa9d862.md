### UX all the things. Bring the Designers in!

One of our objectives was to make something usable, simple and fun. That most people could go from A to B and have a delightful experience at the same time.

We are entering on a phase where Bitcoin is ready. The infrastructure is there, the tech is enough to achieve what it was designed for. So we need to start building experiences and products on top of it. 

This is where UX comes in. Bitcoin doesn’t need to be this niche and dark technology only accessible for the tech savvy, Bitcoin is useful by itself, so it’s time we make it simple and it is time to transform it in something people want to use.

Let me give a couple examples of companies killing it on this area and give some shot outs.

Blockstream for their Green wallet, with the hands of Selene Something on the UX, and the massive improvement that Casa products add recently with Tinder UX guy behind it.

*   It’s very difficult technically to build a wallet
*   Open source is fucking hard
*   Users will lose funds, bugs will happen, test and re-test everything
*   Build it and users will come is a lie
*   Bitcoin eco-system is smaller than you think, it is a niche use case, what is needed for adoption
*   Investment on the space is thriving
*   Build a community, that’s part of your product
*   Leaving your job to focus on Bitcoin, it’s a crazy idea, totally worth it
*   Custodial is a mistake
