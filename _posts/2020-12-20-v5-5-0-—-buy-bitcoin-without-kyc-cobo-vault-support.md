Our last update was in May, and ho boy! We have been busy. On the latest versions a lot of improvements were introduced, most notable the option to Buy Bitcoin from the Local Trader, a p2p marketplace. And, Cobo Vault support, with QR codes, air-gapped PSBTs, one of the first of its kind. Let’s take a closer look on the latest developments and updates. There’s a lot to tell :)

## Cobo Vault support with QR codes PSBTs

Introduced on the version 5.4.4, PSBTs (partially signed bitcoin transactions) with QR codes, this is the first implementation of [BCR-UR (animated QR codes)](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Research/blob/master/papers/bcr-2020-005-ur.md) between software & hardware wallets.

A nice contribution and collaboration with the [Cobo Vault team](https://cobo.com/hardware-wallet). Thank you!

## Buy Bitcoin on Local Trader

v5.4.3 features the ability to buy on the “Local Trader”. A p2p marketplace where you control your funds. You can now login (w/[@hodlhodl](https://hodlhodl.com/)), view offers, view contracts and accept offers. More info on the [Local Trader](https://bluewallet.io/local-trader/)

## Input local currency

We struggle to add this feature, but the requests won’t stop coming, and it is understandable. I hope this will help more than it will cause any problems related to exchange rates, price volatility, etc.\
We are going to keep a look on its evolution closely.

## Camera/Scan on the main screen

There’s now a fast access button from the main screen to access the camera directly. This can be use for different purposes, like, to scan a QR code, to make a payment, to receive a payment, to withdraw a [Azte.co voucher](http://azte.co/), etc.

## Entropy via coins and dice roll

version 5.4.4 also introduces a new advanced feature for the more advanced users out there that don’t want to trust BlueWallet entropy generation. Entropy for wallet generation with Coins and Dices. Have fun! :)

## Support for Electrum wallet seeds

You can *now easily import your Electrum generated wallets to BlueWallet with ease.*

These are the notable changes, a lot more fixes and improvements were made under the hood. The summer is here, and we are not stopping, more goodies to come, more innovations to be released. [Follow us on twitter](https://twitter.com/bluewalletio) to keep an eye on it.
