Ol√°! üëã

Thought it would be cool to share what people are working on at the [Bluewallet](https://bluewallet.io) project.

Usually there‚Äôs not much visibility on open source projects, unless, of course, you are part of the mailing list, IRC channels or chat groups of the project. So a WIP (work in progress) Post seems like a nice idea. It‚Äôs a way to have the community aware, updated, and given a chance to say something. Best to have feelings and violent reactions shared now, than after something is done.üòÉ

We will approach this as a ‚ÄúNow‚Äù and ‚ÄúNext.

Now being what we are working on now and should be hitting production at any moment.

Next being what we will be working on and will come sooner than later.

### What‚Äôs coming up¬†Now?

#### Bech32‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäNative SegWit as the default¬†wallet

Bluewallet [supports many address types](https://bluewallet.io/bitcoin-wallet/). During 2019, we invested most of our time improving and testing our Bech32 wallets. They are now a powerful open financial systems available to anyone for free. And here‚Äôs what you can do with them:

*   Full fee control
*   Save up to 50% in fees
*   Bump your transactions
*   Cancel your transactions
*   Batch multiple transactions

It seems that the time has come, and as [Bitcoin Core](https://bitcoincore.org/) also made bech32 the default type on the latest release, there‚Äôs no reason for us to not do so as well.

### What‚Äôs coming¬†Next?

#### BTCPay Server integration

[BTCPay](https://btcpayserver.org/) has become the Swiss Army knife of the Bitcoin tech stack. From developing applications, running nodes, to integrating with hardware wallets, etc.

It seems obvious to us that bringing this eco-system to Bluewallet, where BTCPay users can have an open source native mobile app to interact with their applications, can be the cherry on top of the proverbial cake.

It solves a real problem - where today, users have their wallets on web frontends, which is something not that secure to do. At the same time, we can work on a native experience to improve the User Experience for the end user, who are, in this case, the merchants and store payees.

This opens interesting scenarios, where people would be able to hack cool things. For instance, it could be to explore NFC (Near Field Communication) solutions to develop open source cards/points-of-sale, and so much more on top of BTCPay and native mobile environments and everything they can bring.

#### Hodl Hodl integration

There‚Äôs this saying on the wallets world, ‚ÄúYou either die a hero or you live long enough to become an exchange‚Äù üòÜ

Bluewallet doesn‚Äôt really want to be an exchange. So integrating with Hold Hodl, where they focus on the exchange technology, so Blue can just focus on the wallet technology, seems like the perfect plan.

Only the future will tell, but I‚Äôm super excited about this one. P2P marketplaces definitely bring a lot of value and they are a huge escape tunnel from the regulated world.

**Why Hodl Hodl?**

No-KYC exchange, non-custodial, P2P transactions, kick-ass multi-sig tech, Lightning on exchanges pioneers, bad-ass group of people. Organizers of the arguably best Bitcoin conference¬†:)

Still at a very early stage, so this is what we can show at the moment. But pretty sure this one will blow many people‚Äôs minds.
