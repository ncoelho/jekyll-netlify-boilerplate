We have been busy building, thatâ€™s a good way to be busy and we havenâ€™t update the blog in awhile, so here it is, an update on the latest releases ðŸ˜ƒ

Weâ€™ve release to production versions 4.5.2, 4.6.0, 4.7.0, 4.7.1 and 4.8.0. These versions include minor new features, bug fixes and user experience improvements. Lots of polishing and small tweaks to make [bluewallet](https://bluewallet.io) more solid and a better free open source product for the community.
