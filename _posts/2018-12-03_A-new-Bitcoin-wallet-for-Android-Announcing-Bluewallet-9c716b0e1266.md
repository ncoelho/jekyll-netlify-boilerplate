### **What is BlueÂ Wallet?**

[Blue Wallet](https://bluewallet.io/) is an **open source project**. A [Bitcoin wallet](https://bluewallet.io/) built by bitcoiners, by community members, by hodlers, by bitcoin maximalists, and by hodlers of last resort. Call us whatever you want. ðŸ˜Ž

But quite simply just by 3 guys who deeply care about bringing bitcoin to the masses. Hi there! We are [Igor Korsakov](https://twitter.com/overtorment), [Marcos Rodriguez](https://twitter.com/marcosrdz) and [Nuno Coelho](https://twitter.com/nvcoelho). ðŸ‘‹

### **Why are we buildingÂ this?**

We were deeply frustrated with the current status of mobile wallet development on Bitcoin. Most of the wallets out there became a shitcoin horror show. Onboarding users to pure speculative useless tokens, where the creators are making money while the normal user is being introduced to scams, frauds on top of being directed to the least interesting aspect of the technology. Wasting time, creating frustration, and thereby resulting to a slow adoption.

We are on a mission to fix that.

We want to bring to the community a wallet focused on the users and their usage. Notice the overuse of the use wordâ€¦

We plan to do that by focusing our efforts on two main pillars: **Security and User Experience**.

Letâ€™s take a look on what our MVP (minimum viable product) looks like.

### 1â€Šâ€”â€ŠSecurity byÂ design

**Open Source**  
Blue Wallet is built on a public repo, up-to-date, and available on the [Blue Wallet GitHub](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet). This means that any user can build it and run it on his own, without any custodial dependencies. Verify the code and contribute to the wallet development. Blue Wallet is made with ReactNative and Distributed under [MIT licensed](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT).

**Plausible deniability  
**A custom made feature thinking about your personal security. Blue Wallet allows you to define a different password which will decrypt a fake wallet set up for any situation you are forced to disclose your access or when you donâ€™t want to or you canâ€™t show your real wallet.

**Full encryption  
**Blue Wallet can encrypt everything with an additional password. Biometric security (touch ID, Face ID) is not secure enough, and because this weâ€™ve given you the option to have an additional password to protect and encrypt your wallet instead.

**SegWit**  
SegWit supported in P2SH-compatibility mode. Segwit was a massive upgrade to the Bitcoin Protocol released in 2017. You will find all wallets with SegWit enabled by default. Find more about [SegWit here](https://segwit.org/).

**HD wallets  
**The Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation and transfer protocol (BIP32), which allows creating child keys from parent keys in a hierarchy. The HD Wallets will generate you different public keys for each transactions.

### 2â€Šâ€”â€ŠFocus on your experience

**Be in control  
**Your **private keys never leave your device**. You are in full control of your private keys. You can, at any moment, generate backups and export/import your wallets, with full control of what to do with your private keys.

**Sentinel wallets  
**Watch-only wallets allow you to keep an eye on your cold storage without touching your private key. Easily import your address or xpub and watch it from your app without ever touching it.

**Flexible fees  
**Starting from 1 Satoshi. You define, with full flexibility, the amount you want to add to your transaction. Blue Wallet also provides you a fee estimation to give you an idea how much to add to your transaction to be included on the next block.

**Replace-By-Fee  
**If you would like to speed up a transaction, Blue Wallet allows to do just that by supporting **RBF**. Speed-up transactions by increasing the fee (BIP125).

**Export TXHEX  
**You can get your transaction HEX (TXHEX) without broadcasting it, and only do it with the relay of your choice.

**Multiple wallet support  
**Blue Wallet aims to support maximum wallet standards. Currently supported: BIP44 (HD), BIP49 (HD SegWit), BIP39 Breadwallet-compatible (m/0'/0/0), Legacy single-address, SegWit single-address (P2SH). You can have as many wallets in a single app at the same time.

### Whatâ€™s comingÂ next?

Ok, all of that is cool. But the future is cooler. Letâ€™s take a look at what is coming next.

So we compiled a list of 4 main focus areas that we are working on at the moment and for the near future. And of course, our [backlog](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/projects/1) and our [roadmap](https://github.com/BlueWallet/BlueWallet/projects/2) are all open for everyone to see and contribute to if anybody should want to do just that.

**Lightning Wallets  
**Wallets with support for the [Lightning Network Protocol](https://lightning.network/). It will bring you unfairly cheap and fast transactions.

**Batch TX  
**Ability to pay multiple addresses with a single transaction. Save on fees and optimize blockspace usage.

**MultiSig TX  
**Add security to your funds. Each transactions requires M of N signatures (with keys stored on different physical devices with Blue Wallet).

**Plug your node  
**Plug your own Bitcoin Core node for a maximum sovereignty.
